# Cell Particle Life

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/tsuhre/pen/dyrjZro](https://codepen.io/tsuhre/pen/dyrjZro).

Loosely based on "Particle Life" by Tientq64.  I was interested to see how the behavior would change if you modified the force grid to a gird of "goal distances" that the particles try to maintain from each other. Additionally, the particles have an orbit bias, encoded as a 'strafe' value.
